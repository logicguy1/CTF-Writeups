## Бабушка (Forensics)

The description of this challange was

```
Привет! Можете ли вы помочь мне добраться до сути этого дела?
```
Translated into english this becomes 
```
Hey! Can you help me get to the bottom of this case?
```
And the title is `Grandmother`

In the DDC challanges they are very knowen for putting hints in the title and descriptions of their challanges

And a file was linked, it was a zip file containing about 7 jpg images, here is a quick dump

```
diachronic-strain.jpg  muted-disconnect.jpg    district-pattern.jpg   
swift-bevel.jpg        all-mayonnaise.jpg      tough-pheasant.jpg
```

After taking a look in gimp the file `muted-disconnect.jpg` stod out to me, it was a russian dull and from that you could say we had to find the "bottom" of it

So i tried to use binwalk on it to see if anything would be hidden inside. This would lead us to a whole bunch of files, extracting them using -e would actually show us an almost exact copy of the folder we just looked at tho the filenames were diffrent

```
[drill@archlaptop Бабушка]$ binwalk muted-disconnect.jpg

Tho no flag was present at this time. I knew that this could continue for a while so i wanted to try and find a quicker way of getting the flag out than opening each of the files and extracting with binwalk. I went out of the folder and ran strings on it

```
[drill@archlaptop Бабушка]$ strings muted-disconnect.jpg | more

The output of this was about 61000 lines so i wrote the output to a file and went digging, very quickly i found that at line 791 we had something looking like a flag:

```
───────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

       │ Size: 370.5 KB

  795  │ grating-cloud.jpg
  796  │ JFIF
  797  │ dExif
 ```
Tho i could not get the flag to be accepted on the website, something was wrong

Reading what the flagname was it would sound something like this

`DDC{bnede_du_alle_dukkerne_selv_eller_kendte_du_mon_binwalk_-e_--matryoshka}`

Now if we translate this into english it would sound like

`DDC{id_you_open_all_the_dulls_yourself_or_did_you_know_binwalk_-e_--matryoshka}`

Now i surely knew binwalk -e but never heard of the flag -matryoshka, so heck why not try it

And we quickly find tha we have a file called `flag.txt` deep inside this file, something fairly interesting to us

So we run bat on the file to see its contents



``` 
[drill@archlaptop Бабушка]$ bat /home/drill/downloads/Бабушка/_muted-disconnect.jpg-1.extracted/_happy-symmetry.jpg.extracted/_stern-roof.jpg.extracted/_colorful-swab.jpg.extracted/_sluggish-debt.jpg.extracted/_central-asset.jpg.extracted/_flashed-pot.jpg.extracted/_sparse-rig.jpg.extracted/_coral-proton.jpg.extracted/_right-gain.jpg.extracted/flag.txt

```

And there we have the full flag

## Hashle (misc)

The description of the challange would be (origionally in danish so translated it)

```
I made a password checker based on the popular game Wordle. Check it out on nc hashle.hkn 1337 and see if you can guess my password.
```

Running this command gives us the following output

```
Welcome to Hashle, the password guessing game!

The rules are simple:
I choose a random password from rockyou.txt and you have 6 tries to guess it.

When you make a guess, I will compute its MD5 hash and compare it to my password's hash.

For each hex digit in your hash, I will provide the following feedback:
    □: Not in my hash
    ◩: In my hash but incorrect position
    ■: In my hash and correct position

If you guess my password, I will give you a reward!
```

And then it prompts us to put in our first geuss

There would be a few solutions to this challange

- Brute force (slow but eazy)
- Calculated (fast but slightly harder)

I of cause chose to go with the calculated route like a real omega chad

I wrote the following python script that would take in 3 random geusses and their hashes then find the most likely correct awnser using the rockyou password list

```py
"""

                break
    if valid:
        hashees.append(i)

print(hashees)
```

This code is not very optimised but finds the right awnser after about 5 minutes, it was written in 15 minutes afterall

Big creds to Nissen who designed this callange, it was really fun :D
